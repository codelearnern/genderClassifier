This is a gender classifier I made/am making in Python because I'm bored.
Also, at this state, the model is all ready to go, I just have to
implement the script that tests the model. I used Numpy, OpenCV, and Keras.

Also, my data is not in this repo, if you wanna see that, check out
https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

ALSO, my model.h5 file isn't in this repo

So yeah, that's that

I might make a video on this on my YouTube channel called Just Program.
